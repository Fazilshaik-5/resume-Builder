Project Overview
This project is a Resume Builder where you can input your personal details, such as name, contact info, education, and work experience, and it will generate a simple resume. It’s a great way for beginners to practice coding skills and learn how to build interactive websites using basic web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
Basic Form: A form where you can enter your personal information like name, contact info, work experience, etc.
Interactive UI: A simple interface that allows users to input their details and see the result immediately.
Resume Preview: Displays your resume in a professional format on the same page.
No Backend Required: Everything works on the front-end, making it perfect for beginners.
Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
All you need is a web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and a text editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++) to edit the code.

How to Install
Clone the Repository:

Open your terminal and type the following command to clone the project:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-resume-builder.git
Navigate to the Project Folder:

bash
Copy code
cd simple-resume-builder
Open the Project in Your Browser:

You don’t need a server! Simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

Right-click on the index.html file and select Open with... your web browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox).
Modifying the Code
Open the files in a code editor (such as Visual Studio Code) and start modifying the content. You can:
Add more fields in the form.
Customize the styling in the CSS file.
Modify the JavaScript to add new functionality (like saving the resume to a file).
How It Works
The app starts with an HTML form where users can input their personal details.
CSS is used to make the page look nice and structured, giving it a simple layout.
JavaScript takes the data entered into the form and dynamically generates a resume by displaying it below the form.
Users can see the resume appear immediately, and they can print it or use it as a template.
This is an excellent exercise for beginners to understand the core web development technologies and see how they work together.
